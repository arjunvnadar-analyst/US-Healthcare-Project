🏥 US Healthcare Case Study: Summary

The overall objective of this analysis is to determine the Impact of Demographics and Admission Types on Healthcare Costs and Outcomes using the provided dataset of 100 hospitals.

📋 Required Analysis Steps
The analysis is broken down into three key areas to derive actionable insights for top executives:

1. Demographic Analysis of Medical Conditions
Objective: Identify the most prevalent medical conditions within different demographic groups.
Analysis: Calculate the frequency of each medical condition, grouped by mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive demographic buckets, to provide a high-level view of disease burden across patient populations.

2. Patient Price Optimization
Objective: Identify trends and recommend ways for patients to reduce their healthcare costs.
Analysis: Calculate the average billing amount across various metrics to determine which factors consistently lead to higher or lower costs. This step should then connect these cost findings back to the prevalence insights from the Demographic Analysis.

3. Hospital Resource Management
Objective: Identify ways for hospitals to better manage their resources.
Analysis: Analyze time-series trends in admission types (e.g., scheduled, emergency) to understand and forecast workload fluctuations, and then suggest improvements for hospital workload utilization.
